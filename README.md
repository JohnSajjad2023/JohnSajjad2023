Cockfighting, an age-old tradition deeply entrenched in the culture of Brahmanbaria, is not merely a sport but a passion that has captured the hearts of enthusiasts for generations. 

In a remote village in Brahmanbariaâ€™s Sarail upazila, Abdur Rouf, a seasoned cockfighting aficionado, stands as a testament to this enduring tradition.

Having delved into this pursuit nearly half a century ago, Abdur Rouf's commitment to the art of cockfighting is unwavering. 

Starting with just four or five roosters, his dedication to the craft has evolved into a full-fledged enterprise spanning regions such as Dhaka, B Baria, Sylhet, and Cumilla. With an unyielding commitment to his birds, he ensures their optimal performance through a carefully curated regimen of specialized nutrition and meticulous training.

These prized roosters, known as "Jawa" if black and "Lakha" if red, undergo an intensive five-month period of specialized care, replete with a diet rich in kismis, Katha Badam, eggs, pigeons, paddy, and pomegranates. Interestingly, maintaining their physical stature at an optimal level is crucial, as an excess of weight can hinder their agility and stamina during the fiercely contested matches that can endure up to four hours.

During these intense bouts, the fervor of the event is palpable, with spectators transfixed by the skill and prowess of these meticulously trained combatants. The stakes are high, with a hefty prize and significant cash rewards awaiting the triumphant owner, while the defeated bird is either sold or consumed.

Cockfighting events have transcended local boundaries, with enthusiasts and experts like Abdur Rouf traversing the country, spreading the fervor of the sport. Notably, historical anecdotes of grand cockfighting spectacles in esteemed venues, such as the Cumilla Cantonment, highlight the cultural significance of this age-old tradition.

In contemporary times, the market for these prized birds has surged, with fighters fetching prices ranging from Tk 30,000 to a staggering Tk 1.2 lakh. Moreover, the allure of these events has attracted the attention of various local organizations, drawing crowds from across the nation to witness the adrenaline-fueled spectacle.

However, amid the excitement and passion, concerns regarding the ethical implications of the practice persist. Questions arise regarding the welfare of these creatures, as well as the impact of such events on societal values and norms.

While the practice of cockfighting remains a deeply ingrained facet of the cultural fabric in certain regions, it also serves as a subject of debate, inviting introspection into the delicate balance between tradition and contemporary ethical considerations.
